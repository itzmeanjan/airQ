'''
    Invoke this method from other script or applications,
    if you want to utilize airQ's data collection capability
    programmatically.

    Get it name of sink file, where to push data into, after collection.

    Well it may be the situation, that you're already having some data,
    collected by airQ, and you want to keep that data and collect new data on
    top of it. But you would also like to invalidate some data if that's older than
    a certain timerange, then you need to use this `collect()` method.

    Second arg of this method ( which is in second ), invalidates all data which are older than,

    (max-timestamp - maxLimit)
    
    i.e. having timestamp, which are lesser than previously computed value.
